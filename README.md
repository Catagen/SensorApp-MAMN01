# SensorApp-MAMN01

Sensor App for MAMN01 interaction design course

*MIN API LEVEL: 21*

The code for this assignment consists of a main activity, which has a menu with two buttons redirecting the user to the compass and accelerometer activities. The way in which to define methods and call them from buttons in MainActivity was derived from [Android Developer: "Build your first app"](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html). The Compass and Accelerometer activity structure of implementing a SensorEventListener, registering listeners and handling the sensor data has been pretty much copied from [Compass tutorial](https://www.wlsdevelop.com/index.php/en/blog?option=com_content&view=article&id=38). I have made some changes to most of the methods, for example creating a media player, loading resources and playing them (derived from [Mediaplayer Overview](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediaplayer)) and changing the background color. The Accelerometer also contains a tone generator, which generates a tone based on the x-axis value of the acceletometer - effectively yielding different tones based on the tilt of the phone. The resources used for this were a combination of [Wikipedia article on PCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation), this [Stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2413426/playing-an-arbitrary-tone-with-android) and the documentation pages for [AudioTrack](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioTrack), [AudioFormat.Builder](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioFormat.Builder) and [AudioAttributes.Builder](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioAttributes.Builder)
