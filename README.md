# SensorApp-MAMN01

Sensor App for MAMN01 interaction design course

The code for this assignment consists of a main activity, which has a menu with two buttons redirecting the user to the compass and accelerometer activities. The way in which to define methods and call them from buttons in MainActivity was derived from [Android Developer: "Build your first app"](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html). The Compass and Accelerometer activity structure of implementing a SensorEventListener, registering listeners and handling the sensor data has been pretty much copied from [Compass tutorial](https://www.wlsdevelop.com/index.php/en/blog?option=com_content&view=article&id=38). I have made some changes to most of the methods, for example creating a media player, loading resources and playing them (derived from [Mediaplayer Overview](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediaplayer)) and changing the background color. The Accelerometer activity also contains some custom logic in the sensor change method, which essentially play different sounds based on the movement of the phone. It's not perfect, but as my project grounp will develop an application with heavy focus on the accelerometer and sounds I figured that might be a better time to fiddle this into perfection.
